\title{Compute Overlap Statistics Between ROI Centers}
\usage{
compute_overlap_stats(centers, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{centers}{A data frame containing ROI metadata with at least the columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{roi_centerx}}{Numeric x-coordinate of each ROI center (in mm).}
  \item{\code{roi_centery}}{Numeric y-coordinate of each ROI center (in mm).}
  \item{\code{roi_type}}{Character label identifying ROI type, typically
    \code{"case"} or \code{"control"}.}
}}

\item{r}{Numeric scalar. Radius (in the same units as coordinates, typically mm)
used to define ROI circular footprints.}
}
\value{
A named list of overlap statistics:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{pairs_total}}{Total number of unique ROI pairs evaluated.}
    \item{\code{pairs_overlapping}}{Count of ROI pairs whose centers are closer
      than twice the radius (i.e., overlapping circles).}
    \item{\code{frac_pairs_overlapping}}{Fraction of all pairs that overlap.}
    \item{\code{frac_pairs_case_case}}{Fraction of overlapping pairs among
      case–case ROI pairs.}
    \item{\code{frac_pairs_ctrl_ctrl}}{Fraction of overlapping pairs among
      control–control ROI pairs.}
    \item{\code{frac_pairs_between}}{Fraction of overlapping pairs between
      case and control ROIs.}
    \item{\code{frac_circles_that_overlap_any}}{Proportion of individual ROIs
      that overlap at least one other ROI.}
  }
}
\description{
Calculates pairwise spatial overlap metrics between regions of interest (ROIs),
given their center coordinates and a specified ROI radius. The function
quantifies how often circular ROIs overlap, both overall and separated by ROI type
(e.g., case vs. control). It is useful for assessing redundancy or spatial crowding
among ROI placements in \pkg{CellNicheR} analyses.
}
\details{
The function computes Euclidean pairwise distances between ROI centers and
identifies overlaps where the center-to-center distance is less than
\eqn{2 * r}. It uses only the upper triangle of the distance matrix to avoid
duplicate pair counting.

\examples{
centers <- data.frame(
  roi_centerx = runif(10, 0, 1),
  roi_centery = runif(10, 0, 1),
  roi_type = rep(c("case", "control"), each = 5)
)
compute_overlap_stats(centers, r = 0.1)
