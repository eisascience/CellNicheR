\title{Plot spatial distribution of biologically plausible SIV-positive cells}
\usage{
plot_spatial_plausible(serobj)
}
\arguments{
\item{serobj}{A Seurat object containing spatial metadata with `x_slide_mm` and
`y_slide_mm` coordinates, and a logical column `SIV_Plausible` indicating
biologically plausible SIV-positive cells.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object showing plausible SIV-positive cells (red) overlaid on
  all other cells (grey). The total count of plausible positives (`N = ...`) is
  displayed in the plot subtitle.
}
\description{
Generates a spatial scatter plot showing the subset of SIV-positive cells that are
biologically plausible infection targets (for example, CD4 T cells, macrophages,
or dendritic cells). Each point represents a cell, positioned by CosMx slide
coordinates, colored red for plausible positives and grey for others.
}
\details{
This visualization focuses on SIV-positive cells that belong to cell types known
to be permissive to infection. It is typically used after calling
`add_SIV_plausible()` to refine the SIV-positive subset based on biological
plausibility. It can reveal tissue regions enriched in likely infected cell types.
